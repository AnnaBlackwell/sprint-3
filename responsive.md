Key features and benefits of responsive design, and advantages over building multiple targeted applications
:
-Different CSS rules will apply to different screen/window sizes, but the same html is used (single code base).
-the screen can look good on any device size and orientation, including devices that will be released in the future. It does this by applying proportions to CSS rules, and creating break points, which change the layout and number of columns displayed.  
-Enhanced functionality (e.g. big tap areas on mobile)

Disadvantages of responsive design:
-It can negatively impact performance on mobile.
-Can cause endless scrolling on mobile if content is not prioritised. 

My opinion:
Responsive design seems like a much smarter option - frontloading some of the work to make web page that is flexible and functional regardless of screen size.
