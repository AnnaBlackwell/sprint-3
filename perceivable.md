I completed most of the accessibility tutorial in Teamtreehouse, which was very straightforward.

Things I hadn't considered before include:
-Legal implications of unaccessible software.
-around 7% of the male population in the USA have red-green colourblindness; this is far more than I would have expected.
-It's best to use font sizes using relative values rather than pixels
-Donâ€™t put text in images.
-Have large clickable areas.
-Minimise number of steps to complete a task (although this is good practice for lots of other reasons).

The Spur App looks like a good tool - I've bookmarked it for later.

Using VoiceOver to browse web pages is tiring, especially with the huge number of links in wikipedia, which I was reading with the use of voice over. It reads out lots of structural things also, which is annoying, but someone using this all the time would get used to it.
