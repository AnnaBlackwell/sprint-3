Empathy Civilisation Video:
This theory describes the shift from feeling empathy to one's blood relatives (tribe), to one's religious community, and to one's nation, and suggests that empathy can and should be extended to all of humanity. One of the problems with this theory is that empathy is emotionally costly; too much leads to compassion fatigue. While a nice idea, I believe that there is too much suffering in the world for any one person to experience, or empathise with, and for that person to also be a productive and functioning human being. The need to 'belong' is fundamental, but to suggest that global empathy will 'save our species and planet' is a bit of a stretch. 

Posture:
