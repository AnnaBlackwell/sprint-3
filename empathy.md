Search Inside Yourself Chapter 3 feedback:
I find mindful listening much easier with young children than with adults. They respond to it in an incredible way. The individuals I’m thinking of have busy parents and busy teachers, who are dealing with a lot, and can’t always give them 100% of their attention without also thinking of the hundreds of other things they have going on. One close friend in particular gets frustrated when I am distracted by my phone. I’m going to work on giving my full attention over this next week.

Empathy Civilisation Video:
This theory describes the shift from feeling empathy to one's blood relatives (tribe), to one's religious community, and to one's nation, and suggests that empathy can and should be extended to all of humanity. One of the problems with this theory is that empathy is emotionally costly; too much leads to compassion fatigue. While a nice idea, I believe that there is too much suffering in the world for any one person to experience, or empathise with, and for that person to also be a productive and functioning human being. The need to 'belong' is fundamental, but to suggest that global empathy will 'save our species and planet' is a bit of a stretch.

Posture:
Because I have a back injury, I am (supposed to be) very aware of my posture.  Long periods of sitting, especially slouched or with crossed legs, puts load on my back, and I'm in a constant battle with myself to sit properly and have frequent breaks.

That posture impacts on emotions is not something particularly new to me, and it is often the basis of advice for performing in job interviews, or public speaking; you can change how you feel by changing your body position, thus changing how you communicate. It's a good reminder.

Accountability group discussion:
Our accountability group didn't do very well this week; I think it was hard enough getting all the rest of the deliverables done.
