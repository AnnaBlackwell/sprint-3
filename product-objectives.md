Problem statement:
Businesses who supply goods and services for mechanical/industrial engineers typically do their marketing through word of mouth, and have minimal online presence, if any. This makes it difficult to shop around and get multiple quotes. Also, when something is urgently needed (within hours or overnight), having multiple options that are easily accessible is advantageous.

Product Objectives:
-To provide a directory of vendors and suppliers who provide goods and services to mechanical and industrial engineering businesses in New Zealand.
-To make it faster and easier for mechanical and industrial engineers to source the specific products and services that they need.
-To encourage local businesses rather than sourcing products from overseas.

Success Metrics:
-The number of vendors/suppliers who sign up.
-Visits from engineering businesses.
-Click-through rate to vendors/suppliers' own websites.
-Possibly include ratings/feedback about the suitability of the information on the site.
